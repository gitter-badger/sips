This repository contains the source for the Scala documentation website, as well as the source for "Scala Improvement Process" (SIP) documents.

## Contributing ##

Please have a look at [http://docs.scala-lang.org/contribute.html](http://docs.scala-lang.org/contribute.html) before making a contribution.
This document gives an overview of the type of documentation contained within the Scala Documentation repository and the repository's structure.

Small changes, or corrected typos will generally be pulled in right away. Large changes, like the addition of new documents, or the rewriting of
existing documents will be thoroughly reviewed-- please keep in mind that, generally, new documents must be very well-polished, complete, and maintained
in order to be accepted.

## Dependencies ##

This site uses a Jekyll, a Ruby framework. You'll need Ruby and Bundler installed; see [Jekyll installation instructions](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for the details.

## Building & Viewing ##

cd into the directory where you cloned this repository, then install the required gems with `bundle install`. This will automatically put the gems into `./vendor/bundle`.

Start the server in the context of the bundle:

    bundle exec jekyll serve

The generated site is available at `http://localhost:4000`

If you add `--watch` at the end of the command line above, Jekyll will automatically watch for changes on the filesystem, and regenerate the site. It can take a few minutes for your changes to appear. Watch Jekyll's output. When you start up you'll see this:

     $ bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
     Configuration file: /Users/ben/src/scala.github.com/_config.yml
                 Source: /Users/ben/src/scala.github.com
            Destination: /Users/ben/src/scala.github.com/_site
          Generating...
                     done.
    Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/Users/ben/src/scala.github.com'

When you change a file, this output will tell you that jekyll is regenerating. It's not done until it says `done.`

    Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
      Regenerating: 1 files at 2014-11-29 09:19:04 ...done.
      Regenerating: 3 files at 2014-11-29 09:21:39 ...done.
      Regenerating: 2 files at 2014-11-29 09:25:10 ...done.
      Regenerating: 2 files at 2014-11-29 09:27:49

If you get `incompatible encoding` errors when generating the site under Windows, then ensure that the
console in which you are running jekyll can work with UTF-8 characters. As described in the blog
[Solving UTF problem with Jekyll on Windows](http://joseoncode.com/2011/11/27/solving-utf-problem-with-jekyll-on-windows/)
you have to execute `chcp 65001`. This command is best added to the `jekyll.bat`-script.

## Markdown ##

The markdown used in this site uses [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) extensions.

### Markdown Editor for OSX ###

There's a free markdown editor for OSX called [Mou](http://25.io/mou/). It's quite convenient to work with, and it generates the translated Markdown in real-time alongside of your editor window, as can be seen here:
